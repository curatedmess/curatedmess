ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ryan Hart. I'm interested in exploring and learning 
about the R programming language for data visualization and a 
little bit of generative art. I mostly code in RStudio and am 
entirely self-taught. I'm a newbie and enjoy tinkering around 
with R code as a creative outlet. 

There's something magical about visualizing with code.
